# sudokuSolver
My code for solving sudoku can solve all sudokus that i can solve. Almost all the easy ones, some medium ones and probably a few hard ones too.
I want to make it solve most of the sudokus, hard ones even. It cannot solve most hard ones simply because i cannot solve them. But i am working 
on it, trying to learn new tricks to solve hard sudokus. If you happen to know any you are most welcome for suggestions.
